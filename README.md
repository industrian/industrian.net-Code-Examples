# industrian.net Code Examples

This repository contains code examples as how they appear on https://www.industrian.net/tutorials

Each folder relates to an individual tutorial. Within them you will find the file **Game1.cs** and other associated files that are used in each tutorial.

Please follow the below advice for these code examples:

- This repository does not contain standalone MonoGame projects, only code examples as they appear in the tutorials.
- Use the **Game1.cs** file as a reference only. Do not overwrite the Game1.cs file in your project.
- The golden rule: Don't copy and paste code without knowing what it does. Follow the respective tutorial to understand what the code does.
